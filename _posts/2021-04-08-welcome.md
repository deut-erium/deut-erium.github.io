Welcome to my personal blog about cybersecurity and computers in general where I host cool challenges (aka assignments) too
<!--more-->
I find it fun to explore and push things to their limits, maybe there would be this kind of stuff in here.  
General topics of interests include Cryptography, SAT/SMT solving, Reverse Engineering, Binary Exploitation, Python and miscellaneous Cybersecurity stuff.  

Head out to different pages to find the things of your interest, you may find something new or a challenging problem :smile:

## What if you get stuck?
Always feel free to DM(direct message) on [discord](https://discord.com/new), Username: deuterium#1689.
Or any other convenient medium of choice.  
Not even on getting stuck, if you solve a challenge, you can brag about it or discuss the way you solved it! 

HACK THE PLANET :metal: :metal: :metal:
